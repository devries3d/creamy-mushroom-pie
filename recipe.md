##INSTRUCTIONS

1. If using frozen puff pastry, take it out of the freezer to defrost and reach room temperature.

2. Preheat the oven to 200°C fan/220°C/gas 7.

3. Cut the mushrooms into thick slices. Slice the leeks into 1cm rounds, including the green parts, and give them a good wash. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Leaving the skins on, cut both lots of potatoes into 1cm pieces.

4. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wide-bottomed non-stick pan on a high heat.Once hot, add the mushrooms and fry for 4–5 minutes until they start to colour, then add the garlic and fry for another couple of minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.

5. Using the same pan, add the sweet potatoes, potatoes, leeks and 1teaspoon of salt. Mix well and cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly.Reduce the heat to low-medium, put a lid on the pan, and leave the veg to steam in their own juices for another 10 minutes, or until the potato sand sweet potatoes are cooked through. Turn off the heat and put the cooked mushrooms back into the pan along with the mustard.

6. To make the bechamel sauce, put a medium saucepan on a high heat and once it’s hot add 8 tablespoons of oil. Sieve in the flour, then, using a whisk, mix together and cook away the raw flour taste for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add 2 teaspoons of salt, 1⁄4 teaspoon of black pepper and the garlic powder and slowly add the oat milk, whisking continuously.Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer for 3-4 minutes until you reach a nice creamy consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper or even some lemon juice if it needs it.

7. Add the sauce to the mushroom mixture, then transfer to a casserole or pie dish (we used a 20 x 30cm pie dish) and leave to cool for half an hour.

8. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and cut it to fit the top of the pie dish. Gently score the top in a criss-cross pattern and lift it on to the pie dish. Crimp the edges of the pastry around the top of the dish using a fork. Brush the top of the pastry with a little extra oat milk to help it turn golden.

9. Cook in the oven for 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crisp. This goes wonderfully on its own, or you could serve it with a green salad orin winter with roasted potatoes.
